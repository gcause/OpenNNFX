This page is all about using the custom indicators provided by OpenNNFX.

NNFX is a framework based on a set of values and principles that uses a number of indicator
categories such as:
- Baseline
- Confirmation
- Volume
- Exit
- Volatility

It combines these indicators to form Algorithms that can be backtested, forward tested and then, when proven to be robust, finally traded live.

The OpenNNFX repository will provide the same set of indicators across all seven (7) supported Trading Platforms:

- TradingView
- Metatrader 4
- Metatrader 5
- Tradestation
- MultiCharts
- CTrader
- Python

That way you know you have a consistent set of indicators utilising the same methods and formulas no matter which platform you use to trade with that you can apply to and use with confidence in your trading algorithms.
