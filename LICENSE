d) Risk Warning

   Leveraged derivative products carry a high level of risk to your capital.
   You should only risk capital that you can afford to lose.
   In certain circumstances due to fluctuations in value you may not get back
   your initial investment amount. You may not only lose your initial investment 
   but you may also incur a liability to pay a further amount.
   
   Leveraged products are only suitable for investors who understand the risks 
   associated with such products and may not be suitable for all investors, you 
   should ensure that you fully understand the risks involved, and seek 
   independent professional advice if necessary.
   
   Trading any financial market involves risk. All forms of trading carry a high 
   level of risk so you should only speculate with money you can afford to lose. 
   You can lose more than your initial deposit and stake. Please ensure your chosen 
   method matches your investment objectives, familiarize yourself with the risks 
   involved and if necessary seek independent advice.
   
e) NFA and CTFC Required Disclaimers:

   Trading in the Foreign Exchange market as well as in Futures Market and Options

   are available for educated and experienced investors who are willing to take 
   above average risk. 
   
   However, before deciding to participate in Foreign Exchange (FX) trading or in 
   Trading Futures, Options or stocks, you should carefully consider your investment 
   objectives, level of experience and risk appetite. 
   
   Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
