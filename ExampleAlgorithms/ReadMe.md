This folder contains Example Algorithms that utilise the Base Templates and Indicators provided for each Trading Platform.

There will be three(3) Example Algorithms provided, they are called:

1. Old Faithful
2. Predator
3. Trade Panther

Each is a unique NNFX Trading Algorithm that you can use as a starting point for your own algorithms and will show you how to apply 
the Base Templates and Indicators provided by OpenNNFX.

They are each fully automated Trading Robots you can apply to your Trading Platform.

The same Example Algorithms will be applied across all seven (7) supported Trading Platforms so no matter which Trading Platform 
you use you will be covered.

Happy Trading :-)
