This folder contains the base templates for a NNFX Trading Algorithm that can be used as the starting point for developing you own Algorithm
to save you the time of putting all the basic NNFX rules in place and allowing you to focus on developing your own NNFX Algorithm.

NNFX is a framework based on a set of values and principles that uses a number of indicator
categories such as:
- Baseline
- Confirmation
- Volume
- Exit
- Volatility

It combines these indicators to form Algorithms that can be backtested, forward tested and then, when proven to be robust, finally traded live.

The OpenNNFX repository will provide the same base template algorithm across all seven (7) supported Trading Platforms:

- TradingView
- Metatrader 4
- Metatrader 5
- Tradestation
- MultiCharts
- CTrader
- Python

The base template algorithm will consist of the code required to implement all the rules, values and principles of NNFX along with good money management and NNFX's risk management strategy.
