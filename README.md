# OpenNNFX
Open source NNFX code repository

OpenNNFX a community based open source repository of all things No Nonsense Forex (NNFX).

I created this repository as a way of giving back to the No Nonsense Forex Community.
I am not associated or affiliated with the No Nonsense Forex Brand in any way.

The aim of this repository is to write simple and easy to ammend code so that everybody 
can use it as a starting point for their own algorithms.

The code will serve as a template for the creation of future NNFX trading strategies as it implements
good money management and employs NNFX (No Nonsense Forex) risk management practices as taught by the 
full-time trader Patrick Victor known simply as VP.

The repository will provide the same set of base code for multiple trading platforms including:

- TradingView
- Metatrader 4
- Metatrader 5
- Python

The code will contain instructions within it as to where the code can be modified for your own
algorithm.

I hope this will serve you well.

Happy Trading :-)

Cheers,

Grant Cause
