# OpenNNFX
Open source NNFX code repository

OpenNNFX a community based open source code repository of all things No Nonsense Forex (NNFX).

NNFX is a framework based on a set of values and principles that uses a number of indicator 
categories such as:
- Baseline
- Confirmation
- Volume
- Exit
- Volatility

It combines these indicators to form Algorithms that can be backtested, forward tested and 
then, when proven to be robust, finallly traded live.

The code provided here encapsulates NNFX (No Nonsense Forex) and provides good money management 
combined with the risk management practices as taught by the full-time trader Patrick Victor 
known simply as VP.

To learn more about NNFX please go to the one source of truth for NNFX, VP's website:

https://nononsenseforex.com

VP has published over 200 videos and podcasts that he has made available to the public explaining 
exactly what NNFX is over on his YouTube channel here:

If you would like to save yourself some time rather than go through the 200+ videos and podcasts 
that VP has published. VP has licensed his intellectual property and together with his good friend 
Dan from Stonehill Forex has published a comprehensive course on NNFX that condenses the knowledge 
located here:

My name is Grant Cause and I have been a member of the NNFX community for quite some time and was
looking for a way of giving back to the NNFX community and hence OpenNNFX was created.

Please note I am not associated or affiliated with the No Nonsense Forex or Stonhill Forex brands 
in any way. I am just a student of VP and Dan learning NNFX like the rest of the NNFX community.
I am just a little further along the learning curve than most, having worked as a professional
analyst programmer for over 3 decades, holding two degrees in Finance and having worked in a 
Proprietary Trading firm as a Quantitative Analyst programming indicators and trading robots
for a living.

Also note the source code provided here is purely for educational purposes to help short-cut the 
learning curve associated with each trading platform. Trading as you know has risks and you should
not trade with money you cant afford to lose.

Your coninued use of this software, in any way, serves as your acknowledgement and representation

that your use of the software is at your own risk.

The aim of this repository is to write simple and easy to ammend code so that everybody 
can use it as a starting point for their own algorithms.

The goal is to assist the NNFX community by-pass the large learning curve associated with each
trading platforms coding language and save them many months of heartache in the process.

By doing this the NNFX community will be able to focus on what matters developing their own NNFX
algorighms.

The code provided here will serve as a template for the creation of future NNFX trading strategies.

The repository will provide the same set of base code for multiple trading platforms including:

- TradingView
- Metatrader 4
- Metatrader 5
- Tradestation
- MultiCharts
- CTrader
- Python

The code will contain instructions within it as to where the code can be modified for your own
algorithm.

My goal is to provide the community with the most comprehensive and easy to use NNFX coding resource 
available on the internet.

I hope this will serve you well.

Happy Trading :-)
